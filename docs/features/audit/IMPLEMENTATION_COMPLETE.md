No new dependencies added - uses existing UI library

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

1. **General Workpaper Form**
   - New fields not yet added to `general-workpaper-form.tsx`
   - Easy to implement (same pattern as create-workpaper-form)

2. **Report Generation**
   - Report preview page not implemented
   - PDF export not implemented
   - Can be added as future enhancement

3. **Mock Data**
   - Currently using in-memory mock data
   - Will need backend API integration for production

- Old audit plans without templates will continue to work
- All new fields are optional
- No data migration required

### For Existing Workpapers
- Will display and function normally
- New fields can be added via edit
- Category information can be added retroactively
